# ERA Client for Dokkan Battle

ERA Client is a reverse engineered client for the game Dokkan Battle. Almost every actions of the official apps can be reproduced by using it.

However, official passwords & data are not included because of obvious legal reasons.

I know that the code is ugly as hell but it's python code and I'm too lazy to write classes, so I went full scripting.

The project will always be open source & free, because I'm not a greedy gnome and I like to disrupt the current market for bots.
